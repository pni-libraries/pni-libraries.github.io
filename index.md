# Welcome to the PNI libraries 

The PNI libraries are a set of C++ libraries developed primarily for working 
with data stored as [NeXus files](http://www.nexusformat.org/). 

## Usage 

As the PNI libraries are developed at DESY it is most natural that most of the 
current applications using them are developed at DESY 

### Tango servers 

* *MTCADigitizer* 
* *PiLCScanSlave*
* *PiLCTriggerGenerator*
* *Xspress3*

* *Gotthard* controller server for the Gotthard detector
* *Lambda* controller server for the Lambda detector
* *Vimba*  

### Bindings to other languages 

* *python-pni* is a simple Python wrapper around the C++ libraries 

### Other applications 

* *pnitools* a set of command line tools to work with NeXus files  
* A tool for managing the calibration data base for Lambda detectors
